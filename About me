I am a Computer Engineer & Analyst with expertise in multiple programming languages (C, C++, Java, Go), and a strong background in Maths/Stats (algebra, calculus, probability, etc). 

My most recent interest in recent years has been in working in computer engineering applied to bioscientific & neuromed applications, for example in clinical projects for drugs or prosthetic implants. I studied and worked in many places. I had activities at the Tokyo Institute of Sciences, Tokyo Institute of Technology, and Tokyo Community Centre, and main Tokyo Hospital.

I live in the UK (London & Cambridge) and Japan (Tokyo & Kyoto) throughout the year. I previously travelled in India, South America, and the USA (California and Massachusetts).
